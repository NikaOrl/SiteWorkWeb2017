We offer you personally and the gaming community as a whole a serious shake-up in the face of the ambitious project "Flat World: Ankh-Morpork." For us, as for you, dear players, it will be an invaluable experience, a grandiose experiment and a huge chance not only to improve old projects, but to create a qualitatively new game.\
It will be an extremely versatile game in which in one mono-location there will be quests and intrigues, politics and economy, secret roles and inhabitants, open mass clashes in alleys and armed conflicts of guilds for power over quarters, customized political murders and stabbing in a tavern for a mug ale, military outings outside the city and wandering adventurers in the sewers, magic and alchemy, poisons and other obnoxious ways to solve your problems.

Inf_3Eph=Our game about temptation - and about how this temptation can change anyone. About great hope, and life without hope. About the "courage of a small man" and about how any of us can influence the fate of the world even without participation in the White Councils: "Fidelity and loyalty to one's ideals." About valor and betrayal. "About Northern Courage" and vows that can to strengthen the weak, and maybe to break. "About the huge armies that will converge in the greatest war of this world, where each side has its own truth - and about the people who live in this war.\

Our game is about the culmination moment in the history of Arda!\
